Do the following:

1. Fork Github repo
2. Create copy a new Unity project into the master branch, with the provided files in directory `Editor`
2. Create a branch containing a text file with some given content (see question 1 below)
2. Create files to pass all tests (see question 2 below)
3. Commit changes
4. Make pull request


## Question 1

Create a branch "limerick"
in that branch create a directory `words` containing a file `computer.md` containing the following:

```
There was a computer that cried
I can think, somehow, deep down inside.
I know it's official
Because I have 'Dell artificial
Intelligence' stamped on my side.

source: http://www.cs4fn.org/limericks/limerickcomp1.html
```

commit the changes to the branch

## Question 2

(do all work on the master branch)
Create files to pass all tests.

NOTE:
- this project is a class for a magical game where spells can be cast at different distances depending on a magic meter, the spell strength, and the level of wizard for the magical character casting the spell
- there is a mixture of data types - see expected result types in the test methods
- there are not any exceptions, however there is a stored error message that can be tested against

- if you get stuck, comment out the test method if it won't compile, so you can get as many tests as possible working


ensdure you commit your working Unity project to master before pushing to you fork, and then making the pull request.
